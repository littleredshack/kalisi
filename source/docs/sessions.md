Claude assessment:
1. Current challenges: Dual engine stacks, renderer coupling, event surface limitations, performance issues, and
  composability problems
  2. Target improvements: Unified layout engine contract, stateful runtime, renderer pipeline overhaul, interaction
  parity, subgraph manipulation, performance foundations, and composable UI shell
  3. Implementation path: 7-step migration from legacy to new architecture
  4. Session notes from 2025-10-10: Debugging work to fix Code Model canvas rendering issues, including state
  isolation per view to prevent cross-canvas interference

  The main theme is transitioning from a legacy system to a declarative, event-driven architecture where layout
  engines are pluggable modules operating on immutable graphs.

● Based on my analysis of the codebase against the architectural plan in sessions.md, here's the assessment:

  Overall Progress: ~60% Complete

  1. Unified Layout Engine Contract — 85% ✓

  Strong foundation established:
  - Formal LayoutEngine interface with LayoutCapabilities in frontend/src/app/shared/layouts/core/layout-contract.ts
  - 4 runtime engines: Tree, ContainmentGrid, Orthogonal, Force (all registered)
  - Immutable graph structures (LayoutGraph, LayoutResult)

  Gaps:
  - Legacy engines still run via ComponentFactory (dual execution paths)
  - Worker execution exists but disabled by default
  - Incremental layout declared but not implemented

  2. Stateful, Data-Driven Runtime — 70%

  Good progress:
  - LayoutRuntime with LayoutOrchestrator + GraphStore + PresentationFrame
  - Versioned snapshots and per-canvas contexts
  - CanvasViewStateService with canvas-specific channels

  Gaps:
  - Services bypass runtime (DynamicLayoutService, history)
  - No backend/worker coordination
  - Runtime not yet the single entry point — ComposableHierarchicalCanvasEngine (2244 lines) still has significant
  logic

  3. Renderer Pipeline Overhaul — 60%

  Partial implementation:
  - PresentationFrame calculates deltas between frames
  - Multiple composable renderers exist
  - Renderer registry maps layouts to renderers

  Critical gaps:
  - Renderers not read-only — canvas engine still mutates extensively
  - No WebGL/WebGPU — only Canvas2D (guide exists but not implemented)
  - Delta calculation exists but incremental rendering not used

  4. Interaction & Automation Parity — 75% ✓

  Well implemented:
  - 11 declarative event types in CanvasEventBus
  - AI integration via CanvasEventHub.processAssistantMessage()
  - History service with undo/redo (50-state limit)
  - Chat panel dispatches canvas events

  Gaps:
  - Legacy imperative methods coexist (toggleNodeCollapsed)
  - No unified timeline (history separate from event bus)
  - AI doesn't receive runtime metrics feedback

  5. Subgraph Manipulation — 50%

  Basic implementation:
  - 3 graph lenses: full-graph, selected-root-neighborhood, active-containment
  - CanvasLayoutRuntime.setLens() support

  Major gaps:
  - Lenses are client-side filters, not streaming queries
  - Hard-coded logic, no declarative API
  - No AI-requestable dynamic lenses
  - Filtering in canvas engine, not data layer

  6. Performance Foundations — 20% ⚠️

  Minimal progress:
  - Worker bridge exists but unused
  - Worker implementation file present

  Critical missing:
  - All layouts run synchronously in UI thread
  - No caching (geometry, text metrics, hit-testing)
  - No virtualization (renders all nodes)
  - No LOD (level-of-detail)
  - No GPU acceleration
  - No scheduling/priorities

  7. Composable UI Shell — 65%

  Decent foundation:
  - Modular panels (chat, properties, event history)
  - Panels subscribe to event bus observables
  - CanvasControlService for centralized control

  Gaps:
  - No docking/layout management
  - Not true micro-frontends (just Angular components)
  - No canvas embedding in other routes
  - Limited theming/transitions

  ---
  Key Blockers to "World-Class" Goal

  1. Performance is the biggest gap — everything synchronous, no optimizations, will stutter on large graphs
  2. Dual execution paths — legacy ComponentFactory vs. new runtime fighting each other
  3. Canvas engine still owns too much — not following read-only renderer pattern
  4. Subgraph queries not first-class — just client-side filters, can't power AI requests

  What's Working Well

  ✓ Layout contract is clean and formal✓ Event system enables AI/automation✓ State isolation per canvas (fixed in
  recent session)✓ Immutable data structures in place

  The architecture is solid but incomplete — good bones, needs the performance layer and full migration from legacy
  patterns.
  
---------

  Where we stand

  - Dual engine stacks: the orchestrator knows only tree/containment/orthogonal/force, but the modular canvas still
    spins up legacy engines (code-model-tree, grid, etc.) through ComponentFactory. We’re translating engine names
    on the fly rather than giving the orchestrator real, pluggable modules. That’s workable for a proof-of-life demo,
    but brittle for performance tuning, feature parity, or onboarding new layouts.
  - Renderer coupling: renderers are still ECS-style classes that mutate nodes in place and expect legacy data
    shapes. We aren’t feeding the runtime’s immutable graph results directly to lean, mode-aware renderers. That’s a
    big gap for FPS, incremental reflow, and GPU-friendly drawing.
  - Event surface, not yet orchestration: the chat panel feeds from the event hub, but most commands still fall
    through to old imperative methods (toggleNodeCollapsed, collapseToLevel). The AI can dispatch LayoutRequested,
    but doesn’t get a canonical “subgraph handle” or derived metrics to reason about. Undo/redo is local; there’s no
    shared timeline for AI vs. human actions.
  - Subgraph views: the data transform pipeline still pulls entire view nodes, clones them, and normalises via legacy
    adapters. We don’t have a streaming, query-based “extract subgraph/transform/present” flow that can be reused
    across map, tree, or timeline views.
  - Performance: layouts run synchronously in the UI thread; even the force engine just blasts through the entire
    node set. There’s no scheduling, no use of Web Workers, no caching of static layers, and no hierarchical LOD. On
    large graphs, we’ll stutter.
  - Composability: the runtime is a good start, but it isn’t yet the single entry point for the canvas. Services
    (history, dynamic layout, view state) still plug straight into the engine, bypassing the runtime. Without a
    clean dependency graph, we can’t easily spin up multiple canvases, embed them in other routes, or hand off layout
    requests to remote workers/AI agents.

  What we need for the “world-class” target

  1. Unified layout engine contract
      - Replace legacy adapters with thin wrappers (modules) that register into the runtime.
      - Engines declare capabilities (incremental, subgraph filters, constraints) and operate on immutable graph
        descriptors.
      - Move layout execution to dedicated workers or the backend for heavy workloads; keep UI thread free for
        rendering and interaction.
  2. Stateful, data-driven runtime
      - One authoritative graph store (versions, snapshots, derived indexes).
      - Orchestrator handles command queue, event routing, history, and multi-canvas coordination.
      - Subgraph queries (filters, clustering) are first-class so AI or the user can spin up a focused view without
        rehydrating whole datasets.
  3. Renderer pipeline overhaul
      - Renderers consume render-ready structures (geometry, styles, transitions) produced by layout + presentation
        transforms.
      - Support multiple rendering backends (Canvas2D, WebGL, WebGPU) via an adapter layer.
      - Incremental frame diffing: the renderer applies only the delta from the last layout, enabling smooth
        transitions and high FPS on large graphs.
  4. Interaction & automation parity
      - All user actions emit declarative events (e.g., RequestCollapse, MoveNode{target, desiredPosition,
        constraints}).
      - Orchestrator resolves them (applying rules, re-running layout) and emits results.
      - Undo/redo becomes timeline-aware (human and AI actions in the same log, branchable histories).
      - Chat/AI layer operates entirely via events/commands, with feedback from runtime metrics (e.g., “layout took
        32 ms, 12 nodes hidden”).
  5. Subgraph manipulation
      - Define per-view “graph lenses” that specify filters, aggregation, computed attributes (clustering,
        containment, dependencies).
      - Any lens can be attached to a canvas, minimap, or analytics widget.
      - Provide an API for AI to request new lenses (“show me components impacting latency > 200 ms”) and visualise
        results on the fly.
  6. Performance foundations
      - Asynchronous layout execution, prioritized updates (move 1 node vs. rerun entire layout).

  - Shared caches for geometry, text metrics, hit-testing.
  - Virtualisation for large graphs (only render nodes in view), adaptive level-of-detail.
  - GPU-accelerated rendering path to handle thousands of nodes smoothly.

  7. Composable UI shell
      - Extract activity bar, properties, chat, and history panels into modular micro-frontends that all subscribe to
        the event bus.
      - Provide docking/layout management so users can arrange panels and canvases.
      - Themeable, accessible design with smooth transitions.

  ———

  A path forward

  - Step 1: Refine the runtime contract (layout engine interface, event taxonomy, graph store). Migrate one legacy
    engine (e.g., grid) into the runtime fully to validate the pattern.
  - Step 2: Build the rendering facade that takes LayoutResult + optional presentation transforms and draws via a
    backend-agnostic renderer. Introduce incremental diffing.
  - Step 3: Move layout execution to workers and add a scheduling layer to orchestrator (command queue, priorities,
    async completion events).
  - Step 4: Formalize the command/event API for AI (collapse/expand, subgraph request, layout switch) and ensure both
    UI actions and chat commands go through the same path.
  - Step 5: Introduce graph lenses/subgraph queries as reusable units; refactor the data loader so every view uses
    them.
  - Step 6: Iteratively upgrade each existing view (code-model, containment) to use the new pipeline; delete the
    legacy adapters once parity is achieved.
  - Step 7: Polish the UI shell: panel docking, canvas minimaps, timeline view, immersive interactions (hover
    insights, command palette).

  Summary

  Right now we’ve proven the runtime can host multiple engines and feed the UI, but we’re still straddling old and
  new worlds. To reach the “world-class, immersive, AI-assisted graph UI” goal, we need to finish the consolidation
  (all layout/rendering through the runtime), formalize subgraph handling, and invest in performance (async layout,
  GPU rendering, diffed frames). That unlocks flexibility for the end user and makes the system truly composable and
  automation-friendly.

  If this direction sounds right, I can start by codifying the runtime contract and migrating one of the legacy
  engines end-to-end, or sketch the orchestration scheduler. Let me know which slice you’d like tackled next.
  
-------------------

What really gets you there

  1. Declarative, data-driven node model
      - Node fields (geometry, metadata, labels, edges) live in a single immutable graph/state store.
      - Layout engines take that graph and emit a transformed graph—nothing mutates it downstream.
  2. Pluggable layout engines with capability flags
      - Each engine (tree, orthogonal, Sugiyama, force, DAG‑reflow, etc.) implements an interface like

        interface LayoutEngine {
          getName(): string;
          apply(graph: LayoutGraph, options: LayoutOptions): LayoutResult;
          canHandleRealtime?: boolean;
        }
      - Engines declare if they support incremental reflow; the orchestrator only runs reflow for engines that opt
        in. Tree returns false, so none of the grid logic touches it.
  3. Event/Observer pipeline
      - All layout/app state updates are events (e.g. CollapseNode, ResizeNode, LayoutApplied).
      - Observers (renderers, AI agents, collaboration layer) subscribe and react without mutating the graph
        themselves.
  4. Renderer(s) read-only
      - Canvas/webgl/HTML renderers consume the LayoutResult and draw; selections/hit testing use the same metrics.
        They never massage coordinates on their own.
  5. Assistant/AI layer hooks into the same event bus
      - AI can propose “expand this branch”, “run clustering layout”, “raise edge weights”—by dispatching the same
        commands a human would. No hidden state.
  6. History & collaboration
      - Because everything is event-based, we can record/replay state for undo, real-time collaboration, or “AI
        explain what changed”.
  7. Runtime layout switching
      - Swap tree → force → orthogonal on the same graph without restarting. The orchestrator unloads the previous
        engine, loads the new one, and re-emits a LayoutResult.

  ### Why the current setup struggles

  - Layout, reflow, and render have been bleeding into each other. We hard-coded sizes, forced 400px in the engine,
    and used different collapsed widths in different modules—every move cascaded.
  - The dynamic reflow wasn’t layout-aware, so it kept battling the tree engine.
  - Metadata wasn’t authoritative; we’d compute the right numbers but never store them globally, so the selector/
    renderer/kernel got out of sync.

  ### What to do now

  We’ve already moved in the right direction today by:

  - Letting the tree engine own width/height and publishing the defaults in metadata.
  - Teaching the reflow service to stand down when displayMode === 'tree'.
  - Keeping the renderer/selector read-only.

  Take that refactor the rest of the way:

  1. Formal layout contract (as above).
  2. Refactor ComposableHierarchicalCanvasEngine so it just orchestrates: load engine → run → publish → render, no
     layout logic inside.
  3. Move all hard-coded shrink/expand to per-layout utilities: tree uses metadata defaults; containment can still
     shrink to 80×40 if it wants.
  4. Expose an event bus (CanvasEvent) so AI, collaboration, undo, etc. plug in cleanly.

  Once that skeleton is in place, you can add more engines, mix AI suggestions, or drive layout changes from data
  alone—and none of the components fight each other. It’s also the only way you’ll scale to those “huge amount more”
  plans without endless back‑and‑forth.

  So, no—the earlier “partial fixes” were not the holistic answer. The right approach is this layered, declarative
  architecture. We just started chipping away at it today; let’s keep going methodically so every new layout is a
  drop-in module instead of a tug-of-war.
  
------------------
you can grab the canvas component or its state service straight
  from the console and dump the whole CanvasData.

  Two easy options:

  1. Call the engine directly

     ng.getComponent(document.querySelector('app-modular-canvas')).engine.getData()
     That returns the exact structure the renderer is using (nodes, edges, camera, etc.).
     That returns the exact structure the renderer is using (nodes, edges, camera, etc.).
  2. Go through the shared state service

     ng.getInjector(document.querySelector('app-modular-canvas'))
       .get(ng.coreTokens.CanvasViewStateService)
       .getCurrentState('modular-canvas')

     (Replace the string if you’re on a different canvasId.) This is the authoritative snapshot that gets published
     to the collaborative layout pipeline.

  Either object is safe to console.log or JSON.stringify whenever you want a full dump.


› And can you call one of those directly from here?


• I can’t execute browser console calls from this CLI—the Angular component tree and window scope live in your
  running frontend, not in this shell. Grab the snippet:

  ng.getComponent(document.querySelector('app-modular-canvas')).engine.getData()

  …and paste it into your browser’s devtools console with the Code Model view open. That will dump the live
  CanvasData there.

  

# Session: Code Model Canvas Debugging (2025-10-10)

## User Goals
- Restore the Code Model canvas view, which rendered blank despite queries returning thousands of nodes.
- Ensure Angular build artifacts deploy reliably so the gateway serves current bundles.
- Diagnose and resolve cross-canvas interference that was pushing the Code Model viewport off-screen.

## What Was Done
1. **Rebuilt and Sanitised Assets**
   - Cleared old hashed bundles and pointed `angular.json` outputPath directly at `/workspace/runtime/frontend/dist`.
   - Rebuilt Angular multiple times, ensuring `index.html` references the latest `styles`, `runtime`, `polyfills`, and `main` hashes.
   - Removed stale bundles (e.g., `main.b231…`) so MIME errors disappeared.

2. **Instrumented Rendering Path**
   - Added temporary logs and overlays in `ComposableHierarchicalCanvasEngine` and `HierarchicalNodePrimitive` to confirm the renderer executed and to inspect screen-space bounds.
   - Verified the engine rendered the root node at `(x: 50, y: 50)` with size `≈ 993 × 400` but it later ended up off-screen (`screenY: -32992`), which hinted at external camera mutations.
   - Removed all debug visuals once diagnostics were complete.

3. **Isolated Canvas State per View**
   - Refactored `CanvasViewStateService` to store snapshots/mutations by `canvasId` and expose `getCanvasData$(canvasId)`.
   - Updated `ComposableHierarchicalCanvasEngine` to accept a `canvasId`, subscribe only to its own state stream, and publish back with the same `canvasId`.
   - Updated `DynamicLayoutService` so it reads the originating `canvasId`, clones that canvas' state, and publishes reflow results back to the same channel.
   - Set each `ModularCanvasComponent` instance's `canvasId` to the current ViewNode id, so different views never cross-pollinate camera/layout updates.

4. **Cleaned Repository**
   - Removed obsolete local scripts (`test_agent*.sh`, `test_files*.sh`, `test_tree_agent.rs`).
   - Committed changes as `de8c4f1 Isolate canvas state per view` and pushed to `origin/main`.

## What I Learned About the Codebase
- **Observer Model**: Canvas engines publish full state snapshots to `CanvasViewStateService`; other collaborators (like `DynamicLayoutService`) react to mutations and issue derived updates. Before today, this service acted as a global singleton without `canvasId`, allowing one engine’s camera to overwrite another’s.
- **Rendering Pipeline**: 
  - ViewNode → `ComponentFactory` selects layout + renderer.
  - `LayoutEngineAdapter` + `GridLayoutService` produce the hierarchy (many nodes nested under a single root).
  - `ComposableHierarchicalCanvasEngine` creates the renderer, wires shared state, applies collapse/default hierarchy, and renders via `ComposableContainmentOrthogonalRenderer` + `HierarchicalNodePrimitive`.
  - Previously, all canvases shared the same state bus; now each uses a dedicated channel keyed by `canvasId`.
- **Persisted View State**: The database stores ViewNode `layout` JSON and `autoLayoutSettings` (collapse/reflow). Those are separate from the runtime `CanvasViewStateService`; DB state is only restored on explicit save/load, while the service handles live inter-component communication.
- **Collapse Flow**: `collapseToLevel` still sets descendants via `showImmediateChildren`/`hideAllDescendants`. We verified root nodes remain expanded after the state isolation change.

## Outstanding / Recommended Next Steps
* Current status: Code Model canvas still renders blank and MIME errors persist; root node is drawn far off-screen (~25k x 35k).
1. **Camera Reset Logic**: Even with state isolation, the root node can still be off-screen if the stored camera in the DB is out of range or if the layout pushes heights beyond the initial viewport. Add a fallback centering routine (`centerOnInitialNode`) that runs after layout when no saved camera is present.
2. **Layout Diagnostics**: The root node reports thousands of children (8470) yet remains visually empty. Investigate whether `showImmediateChildren` + `hideAllDescendants` hides everything by design (collapsed badges) or whether we should render a placeholder when a container has collapsed children.
3. **Consistent Build Script**: Encapsulate the Angular build + hash cleanup into a single script (or CI job) to avoid manual rsync/index rewrites.
4. **Restore Single-Command Build Workflow**: Update `start.sh` (or similar automation) so it runs the Angular build, removes stale hashed bundles, copies the latest output into `/workspace/runtime/frontend/dist`, and then launches services. The goal is to get back to your “one command” workflow; ad-hoc rebuilds are still painful.
5. **Remove Ad-hoc Logging**: Any lingering `console.warn` or debug logs added during ongoing investigation should be cleaned up once the core display issue is resolved.
6. **Verify with Fresh Sessions**: After resetting the camera and layout logic, spin up a fresh environment to ensure the Code Model view renders at first load without needing manual zoom/pan.

The state-isolation refactor is now in place. The remaining work is to make sure the root node actually draws visible content (or at least its collapsed placeholder) once the camera is centred. Continuous testing with multiple canvases open simultaneously is recommended to validate the new per-canvas channels.
