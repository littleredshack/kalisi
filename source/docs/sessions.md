THE LATEST THING WE ARE WORKING ON

----------------

  Here’s what I’ll do next so it lines up with the architecture we agreed on:

  1. Stop using OverlayService.applyNodeGeometry for drag/resize. That overlay layer is meant for occasional overrides, not every mouse
     move.
  2. Store 2D positions directly on the ViewState (per node). That gives us the single “Presentation” graph the doc talks about.
  3. Make layout updates pull positions from the view state first, then fall back to the raw dataset. Overlay has no say in node
     coordinates anymore.
  4. Update the drag handler to mutate ViewState live, so the JSON panel shows the change immediately and we don’t need commit/clone
     hacks.
  5. Leave the canonical (Neo4j) dataset untouched, letting crawler/delta updates roll in just like before.

  I’ll start implementing this ViewState geometry layer now so dragging a child node actually sticks.


› And why do we have iewState or canvasData?  Why do we have both of those ?


• Right now they exist because we’re straddling two different metaphors:

  - canvasData is the live, hierarchical scene the renderer consumes: recursive nodes, edges, camera. It’s the thing the runtime engine
    mutates in-memory for hit-testing, selection, etc.
  - viewState was introduced to hold config for the view—“global: flat layout”, per-node renderer choices, saved camera, etc.—without
    touching the raw dataset. It’s supposed to be declarative.

  In practice we’ve ended up storing geometry in both places: dragging updates canvasData, but overlays (viewState → overlay resolver)
  reapply the old geometry and the node snaps back. That’s why it feels like duplication and whack-a-mole.

  So the fix should be: pick one owner for render geometry. Either (a) let canvasData be the authoritative copy and strip geometry
  overlays entirely, or (b) move positions into viewState and regenerate canvasData from it every time. Keeping both in sync is what’s
  hurting us.

  Given the architecture doc’s intent (“immutable dataset + view overlays”), option (b) is cleaner: dataset stays raw, viewState captures
  user presentation choices, layout runtime renders a canvasData snapshot from those two inputs. No clones, no fighting between layers.
  The controller would mutate viewState directly on drag/resize, and the runtime just re-emits a fresh canvasData every frame.

  If you’d rather lean on (a) and drop viewState until we truly need separate configs, we can do that too. The important part is getting
  down to a single source of truth for geometry. Let me know which way you’d prefer and I’ll implement it.


› No. That is unacceptable. Why do we need a canvasData snapshot at all ?


• Totally fair pushback. The “canvas data snapshot” only exists because we never fully flipped over to the new architecture—so the old
  engine still passes around mutable CanvasData, while the new view-state idea is half-baked. If we embrace the architecture we wrote
  down, we can retire that snapshot entirely. Here’s how:

  1. Single Presentation Object
     Build a ViewGraph (or whatever we call it) that merges the immutable dataset with the view state. That’s the only structure the
     renderer touches. No interim CanvasData clones.
  2. Direct Mutation
     When you drag, resize, or toggle containment, mutate the ViewGraph. History/log panels subscribe to it, so the debugger shows the
     changes immediately—exactly like the old setup.
  3. Layout Input ≈ ViewGraph
     Layout engines consume that same object. If we need to re-run layout, we pass the current ViewGraph. When layout finishes, we feed
     the result right back into the same object. No canonical/model copies.
  4. Immutable Dataset untouched
     The raw Neo4j dataset stays read-only. Realtime deltas update it, and we have logic to reconcile view state when nodes go away.
  5. No Geometry Overlays
     OverlayService returns to styling/visibility only. Geometry is native data on the view graph.

  So to answer your question: in this model, we don’t need a canvasData snapshot at all. We’d have:

  - GraphDataSet (immutable from Neo4j)
  - ViewState / ViewGraph (mutable, user-controlled presentation + layout output)
  - Renderer/layout operate directly on ViewGraph

  I can start refactoring toward that now—strip out the overlay geometry calls, replace the snapshot clones with direct updates, and move
  the runtime controller/renderer to read the view graph directly. Let me know if you’re ready for me to take that swing.

  ---------------

  
Simplification Ideas

  1. Feed raw Neo4j data directly into the real CanvasLayoutRuntime.setRawData, removing the temporary runtime and collapsing conversions
     into a single pass.
  2. Treat CanvasLayoutRuntime as the sole owner of CanvasData; expose read-only snapshots (or lightweight diffs) and stop writing back
     into this.data inside the component.
  3. Replace pervasive deep clones with an immutable graph representation or structural sharing (e.g. Immer) so history/view-state can
     reuse the same objects while maintaining safety.


› I agree and want to implement radically all these 3 steps. On point 3, my idea has always been that each Set of Data has a query which
  gives us the raw nodes and edges. These contain no visual data and should never be expected to. We then decide how to layout these
  nodes and edges and how to style them. We do all that by having confugration in the canvas with layout and styling options. The layout
  and the styling and any other visual state is stored in a View. So the frontend must have one object that represents the original data
  and one object that is the View that the user is looking at. And that view could contain a mix os all sort of different layout and
  rendering engines all working together on the canvas. So we could have a tree view for a node and its desccdants while another node and
  it children could be a in containment layout


• This is a big restructuring plan to separate raw data from view state using immutable data models in the runtime components. I’m
  cleanly. The plan also includes freezing data to ensure immutability and carefully adjusting constructors and data flow to avoid
  breaking existing logic while streamlining runtime data handling.

› Assess my suggestion and offer you perspective and recommendations


• I’m preparing a thorough evaluation of the suggested steps to handle raw data and runtime layout separately. I’ll cover the feasibility
  of feeding raw data directly into the runtime, making the runtime the sole canvas data owner, and maintaining separate data and view
  objects with mixed layout support per node. My plan is to offer clear recommendations, highlight important architectural considerations
  like centralizing raw data in a GraphDataStore and mapping layout views per node, and caution about risks like runtime complexity when
  mixing layout engines. I’ll reference relevant files and aim for an incremental approach.

• You’re on the right track. What you’re proposing aligns with what the code is already trying to do, but the current implementation
  doesn’t enforce those boundaries; that’s why the cloning and state churn exploded. Here’s how I’d shape it and what to watch for:

  - Single Raw Graph Source. Introduce a durable GraphDataSet abstraction (per ViewNode/Set) to hold the canonical {nodes, relationships}
    straight from Neo4j, never mutated. Neo4jDataService.executeViewNodeQuery and friends should populate this once, without rebuilding
    temporary runtimes (frontend/src/app/core/services/neo4j-data.service.ts:180). Subsequent layouts read from it, but never write back.
  - View State As Composition. Take your “View” idea literally: a ViewState that references the raw dataset by id and carries
    all visual concerns—layout engine assignments, renderer settings, per-node overrides, edge routing hints, camera, history.
    RuntimeCanvasComponent should hold just {dataSetRef, viewStateRef} instead of juggling this.data, temp runtimes, and raw arrays
    (frontend/src/app/components/modular-canvas/runtime-canvas.component.ts:347).
  - Runtime As The Sole Mutator. CanvasLayoutRuntime becomes the only place that can produce a mutable CanvasData for rendering. The
    component never reassigns this.data = engine.getData() anymore (runtime-canvas.component.ts:270); instead, it subscribes to immutable
    snapshots (or diffs) emitted by the runtime. CanvasHistoryService and CanvasViewStateService should record references or patches
    rather than deep clones once the data/view split exists (frontend/src/app/core/services/canvas-history.service.ts:18, frontend/src/
    app/shared/canvas/state/canvas-view-state.service.ts:40).
  - Flexible Layout Composition. With raw data and view state separated, mixing engines becomes feasible: apply layout profiles
    per node (or region) in ViewState, then let the runtime resolve them dynamically. You already have the scaffolding in
    CanvasLayoutRuntime.resolveProfileForNode and overlay support (frontend/src/app/shared/canvas/layout-runtime.ts:358); the change is
    to move those configs out of ad-hoc metadata and into the formal view definition so different subtrees can run different strategies.

  Recommendations to get there:

  1. Refactor Loading: Make Neo4jDataService return a GraphDataSet and have RuntimeCanvasComponent pass it straight into the live
     CanvasLayoutRuntime.setRawData. Drop the temporary runtime instantiation paths (runtime-canvas.component.ts:690).
  2. Define View Contracts: Introduce ViewState/ViewProfile interfaces, rewrite createEngineWithData so it instantiates the runtime with
     {graphDataSet, viewState} instead of raw CanvasData, and persist those view profiles on the View entity you already store server-
     side.
  3. Rework Runtime APIs: Expose read-only snapshots or diff streams from CanvasLayoutRuntime and update history/view-state services to
     consume them without cloning the full graph. That’s the point where you can remove cloneCanvasData everywhere.

  This will be a sizeable change, but it’s the right direction: one immutable raw graph, one structured view definition, and a runtime
  that projects the two into the canvas without bouncing through half a dozen intermediate copies.

  --------------------
  

Runtime Flow

  - Neo4j calls are funneled through services/api-gateway/src/handlers/runtime.rs:20, which validates the Cypher payload, tags it with a
    deterministic query id, and delegates execution to the pooled Neo4jGateway.
  - Neo4jGateway.execute (services/api-gateway/src/database/neo4j_gateway.rs:65) streams rows from Neo4j, captures metrics, and
    normalizes the raw response into JSON {results, count} without imposing layout rules.
  - The runtime canvas contract is assembled in build_canvas_response (services/api-gateway/src/runtime/canvas.rs:25): it walks Neo4j
    rows, extracts canonical nodes/edges (including display hints like dimensions, colors, icons, containment GUIDs), and returns a
    CanvasGraphDto payload designed for layout engines.
  - Frontend consumption starts in Neo4jDataService.executeViewNodeQuery (frontend/src/app/core/services/neo4j-data.service.ts:180),
    which looks up the ViewNode definition, runs /runtime/canvas/data, and converts the canonical DTO into engine-friendly entity/
    relationship arrays while preserving display metadata.
  - RuntimeCanvasComponent (frontend/src/app/components/modular-canvas/runtime-canvas.component.ts:347) ties a selected ViewNode to the
    canvas: it reloads ViewNode settings, chooses engines/renderers, instantiates RuntimeCanvasController, and feeds either saved layouts
    or freshly transformed Neo4j data.
  - Layout and rendering responsibilities stay in the runtime layer: RuntimeCanvasController (frontend/src/app/shared/canvas/
    runtime-canvas-controller.ts:27) manages camera + data orchestration, CanvasLayoutRuntime (frontend/src/app/shared/canvas/layout-
    runtime.ts:1) owns layout execution and raw-data transforms, while renderers like RuntimeContainmentRenderer (frontend/src/app/
    shared/composable/renderers/runtime-containment-renderer.ts:1) focus purely on painting.

  Realtime Path

  - Write-oriented Cypher requests that include a view_node_id trigger try_emit_delta (services/api-gateway/src/graph_events/emit.rs:31),
    which inspects the Neo4j response, extracts affected GUIDs, and publishes a GraphDelta via Redis streams.
  - WebSocket clients subscribe through /ws; websocket_handler (services/api-gateway/src/websocket.rs:25) spins up a Redis consumer
    scoped to the requesting ViewNode and relays matching deltas.
  - The Angular Neo4jRealtimeService (frontend/src/app/core/services/neo4j-realtime.service.ts:53) manages WebSocket lifecycle, emits
    delta observables, and throttles reconnects.
  - RuntimeCanvasComponent.setupRealtimeSubscription (frontend/src/app/components/modular-canvas/runtime-canvas.component.ts:852) feeds
    those deltas into the active RuntimeCanvasController, which applies incremental node/edge mutations while preserving interaction
    state.

  Separation of Concerns

  - Backend keeps a tight split: Neo4j access (Neo4jGateway), DTO assembly (runtime/canvas.rs), and event emission (graph_events) are
    independent modules wired only at the handler layer. Layout is never inferred server-side—the contract is “positions optional,
    hierarchy + styling hints only.”
  - Frontend layers respect roles: Neo4jDataService is data-only, RuntimeCanvasComponent handles ViewNode orchestration,
    RuntimeCanvasController is the runtime façade bridging input data to layout runtime, CanvasLayoutRuntime runs algorithms and edge
    inheritance, and renderer classes paint pixels.
  - The ViewNode entity effectively stores presentation presets (layout engine choice, saved layouts, containment defaults) while the
    data query remains a single Cypher statement, so the same node/edge set can be rendered with containment, tree, or flat views without
    altering the raw graph fetch.

  Natural next steps:

  1. Exercise the flow end-to-end with /runtime/canvas/data queries for representative ViewNodes to confirm node display metadata is
     sufficient for chosen layouts.
  2. Attach debugger/logging around GraphDelta to ensure redis/WebSocket wiring aligns with selected ViewNode ids before layering in more
     visual customization.

------------------------------


• Runtime Architecture

  - Canonical Graph Store (CanvasLayoutRuntime.modelData, GraphStore): holds the exact Neo4j snapshot; never mutated by UI or layout
    systems. Realtime deltas (neo4j-realtime.service) update this store only.
  - View Overlay Store (new module): layered, immutable overlays keyed by node/edge GUID. Holds user preferences (styles, containment
    mode, layout overrides). Supports cascading: each overlay entry can mark inheritance rules or subtree stops. Stored per canvas
    instance, saved alongside presets.
  - Runtime Layout Pipeline (CanvasLayoutRuntime.runLayout):
      - Fetch canonical graph snapshot.
      - Resolve cascade effective config via new OverlayResolver, combining global defaults, ancestor overlays, per-node overrides.
      - Feed resolved config into engine (ContainmentRuntimeLayoutEngine, future strategies). Engine reads overlay-provided flags
        (containment mode, layout/renderer selections) but positions nodes based only on canonical geometry + resolved config.
  - Presentation Pipeline (buildPresentationFrame):
      - Start with layout result.
      - Apply overlay styling to nodes/edges (fill, stroke, badges, visibility).
      - Attach renderer hints (e.g. visibility flags) without touching canonical data. RuntimeContainmentRenderer / RuntimeFlatRenderer
        render according to these hints.

  Overlay Model

  interface OverlayPatch {
    scope: 'node' | 'subtree' | 'global';
    style?: Partial<NodeStyleOverrides>;
    layout?: Partial<NodeLayoutConfig>;
    containment?: 'containers' | 'flat' | 'inherit';
    edgeVisibility?: Record<string, boolean>;
    updatedAt: number;
    author: 'user' | 'system';
  }

  - Stored in ViewOverlay with maps for nodes, edges, and global defaults.
  - Supports cascade: subtree overlays apply to descendants until a stop flag. inherit values defer to parent chain.

  Editor Integration

  - Node Style Panel updates overlay via OverlayService.applyNodeStyle(guid, overrides). Service emits overlay change event so runtime
    schedule layout/render refresh.
  - Future per-node containment: overlay entry on node sets containment mode for subtree.

  Realtime Compatibility

  - Deltas mutate canonical store. Overlay untouched.
  - When nodes/edges added, overlay can auto-inherit parent settings (via resolver default). Removed nodes drop overlay entries
  Implementation Plan

  Phase 1: Overlay Infrastructure

  1. Introduce OverlayStore (types + service) under frontend/src/app/shared/canvas.
      - Track overlays, cascade resolution helpers, serialization.
  2. Extend CanvasLayoutRuntime to hold overlay reference (inject via constructor setter). Add setOverlay/ getOverlay.
  3. Implement OverlayResolver used inside runLayout and presentation to get effective config/styling per node/edge.

  Phase 2: Layout/Rendering Integration

  1. Update ContainmentRuntimeLayoutEngine (and other engines) to accept resolved config per node (containment mode, layout strategy). No
     more mutating edges; visibility from overlay.
  2. Adjust buildPresentationFrame to clone canonical result, then apply overlay styling before returning canvasData.
  3. Update renderers to rely on overlay-provided metadata (already filtered via presentation pipeline). Remove direct style mutations
     and the setCanvasData hack in RuntimeCanvasController.applyNodeStyleOverride.

  Phase 3: Editor + Control Wiring

  1. Create OverlayService to expose Rx stream of overlay snapshots. Canvas controllers subscribe to re-render after overlay changes.
  2. Refactor node style HUD: on change, call OverlayService.applyStyle. Remove direct node mutation.
  3. Containment toggle: call OverlayService.applyGlobalContainment. No refetching raw data.

  Phase 4: Migration & Cleanup

  1. Remove mutations to canonical data across renderers/controllers (setCanvasData calls inserted earlier).
  2. Update realtime delta handler to respect overlay (new nodes inherit via resolver, overlays removed when GUID disappears).
  3. Persist overlay with view presets / layout saves (serialize overlay snapshots).

  Phase 5: Verification

  1. Unit tests for overlay resolver (cascading, inheritance, stop points).
  2. Integration tests: apply style, toggle containment, ensure layout/resolution stable.
  3. End-to-end Playwright: style node, switch containment modes, confirm colors persist and containment layout reinstates.

  _________________


> I want a new floating panel like the Styles panel. IT should be called the layout panel and be avaialble on the activity bar. It should be activiated with the keystroke Option-L and havea tooltip 
"Layout (L)". . Secondly, we are working only with the Containment Runtime-Merge View. When I open that View it should display EXACTLY as it does currently. When I open the Layout Panel I should see
 that 'Containment' is enabled. If Containment is not enabled then the graph should draw as a regular flat graph with all nodes connected by lines. We can start by applying this to the top level 
nodes. We can do cascade once we have the toggle between these two rendering options working. In both cases (Containment on or off) the Layout option should be set to Grid. Other layout options will
 br forece and tree. Later. So then we can achieve exactly the same view that I have now. But with configurable options and codebase that we can extend. Edge routing can also be a drop down. 
Orthogonal is what we have in the current view. ALL the code that underlies the Containment Runtime-Merge VIEW  MUST remain in place. DO NOT try to rewrite it. IT MUST be used as is. It has take 
nweeks to get that right and has just been ported to this system. So it must remain. That was all part of hte planning pahse for  this. 
  ⎿  Interrupted · What should Claude do instead?

> Also bear in mind that ALL of this must be done with the observer pattern that is already in place. 

● Perfect! Now I have a crystal clear plan. Let me confirm my understanding:

  Layout Panel UI Plan

  1. New Floating Panel

  - Name: "Layout Panel"
  - Location: Activity bar (sidebar, like Styles panel)
  - Keyboard: Option-L
  - Tooltip: "Layout (L)"

  2. Scope

  - ONLY applies to: Containment Runtime-Merge view
  - When I open that view → everything looks exactly as it does now
  - Layout Panel shows: Containment: ON (current state)

  3. Controls (Simple Start)

  - Containment Mode: Toggle (ON/OFF)
    - ON = Current behavior (nested boxes, CONTAINS edges hidden)
    - OFF = Flat graph (all nodes connected by lines, CONTAINS edges visible)
  - Layout Strategy: Dropdown (Grid selected by default)
    - Options: Grid, Force (disabled/later), Tree (disabled/later)
  - Edge Routing: Dropdown (Orthogonal selected by default)
    - Options: Orthogonal, Straight (later)

  4. Top-Level Only Initially

  - Apply config to top-level nodes first
  - Cascade comes later once toggle works

  5. Critical Constraints

  - ✅ Use existing Containment Runtime-Merge code AS-IS
  - ✅ DO NOT rewrite the engine - it stays exactly as it is
  - ✅ Use Observable pattern - CanvasControlService observables + CanvasEventHubService
  - ✅ Default state matches current view - Containment ON, Grid, Orthogonal

  Observable Flow (Already Built)

  Layout Panel Component
    ↓ calls
  CanvasControlService.setContainmentMode('flat')
    ↓ emits
  RuntimeConfigChanged event → CanvasEventHubService
    ↓ subscribes
  Canvas Component listens
    ↓ calls
  runtime.setViewConfig({ containmentMode: 'flat' })
    ↓ triggers
  runLayout() with new engineOptions
    ↓ engine responds
  Shows flat view with CONTAINS edges

  Ready to implement? I'll create:
  1. Layout panel component
  2. Add to activity bar
  3. Wire observables
  4. Test toggle between containment ON/OFF

  ______________
  
  Critical UI Questions:

  1. Where do users control this?
    - Properties panel (where there's already a containment toggle)?
    - Canvas controls toolbar?
    - A new dedicated "View Config" panel?
  2. What controls exactly?
    - Containment Mode: Toggle? Radio buttons? Dropdown?
    - Layout Mode: Dropdown (grid/force)?
    - Edge Routing: Dropdown (orthogonal/straight)?
  3. Global vs Per-Node?
    - Do we start with just global controls (affects whole canvas)?
    - Or also add per-node overrides (right-click node → configure)?
    - NodeConfigManager is built but no UI for it
  4. Visual Feedback
    - How does user know what mode they're in?
    - Real-time preview or apply button?
    - Indicator showing "Container Mode" vs "Flat Mode"?
  5. Integration Points
    - When user changes mode, do we auto re-layout?
    - Or just change renderer (keep positions)?

    ______________________________
    
● The complete rendering pipeline is:

  1. ContainmentRuntimeLayoutEngine.layout() produces LayoutGraph with relative coordinates (x:48, y:48 for children)
  2. buildPresentationFrame() calls layoutGraphToHierarchical() which converts flat LayoutGraph to hierarchical tree
  3. HierarchicalNodePrimitive.draw() recursively draws nodes, adding parent coordinates: worldX = parentX + node.x
  _____________

  
 
  The math says it SHOULD fit. But the image shows children extending outside parents.

  The algorithm should be:

  1. Start at leaf nodes (no children) - they get base size (220×132)
  2. For each parent, bottom-up:
    - Recursively layout all children first (so we know their final sizes)
    - Position children: Start at y=padding(48), stack vertically, x=padding(48), gap=24 between
    - After positioning, find the maximum right edge and bottom edge of all children
    - Set parent width = max_right_edge + padding(48)
    - Set parent height = max_bottom_edge + padding(48)
  3. Critical: When positioning a child at (x, y), that child's bounding box is:
    - Right edge: x + child.width
    - Bottom edge: y + child.height

  The parent must be sized to contain that bounding box plus padding.

  Is resizeToFitChildren doing this correctly? Or is it just looking at child positions without accounting for their full
  width/height?


## Session 2025-10-16 – Runtime Containment Migration

- **Scope**: Stand up the new runtime-only pipeline for the Containment Orthogonal view without falling back to saved layouts.
- **Key outcomes**:
  - Captured a canonical runtime payload (`frontend/runtime-samples/containment-runtime.json`) showing the real schema (`guid`, `parent_guid`, `position`, `display`, badges).
  - Rebuilt `runtime-graph-normalizer.ts` to preserve hierarchy, world coordinates, styles, badges, and edge metadata (no more synthetic `contains-*` nodes).
  - Implemented `ContainmentRuntimeLayoutEngine` to respect explicit geometry, only falling back to adaptive packing when positions are missing, and to route edges using world coordinates.
  - Updated the layout registry, engine registry, and component factory so `layout_engine === 'containment-runtime'` selects the new engine/renderer pair.
  - Converted `Neo4jDataService.convertRuntimeGraph` to treat canonical `LINK` payloads as relationships; the runtime now reports `entityCount: 7`, `relationshipCount: 6` (matching the legacy view), so “Link 11” renders as an edge instead of a node.
  - Added explicit logging (`[RuntimeContainment]`, `[LayoutRuntime]`, `[ContainmentRuntimeEngine]`) to verify the pipeline end-to-end; these now emit in development builds.

- **Database structure refresher** *(Neo4j)*:
  - `SetNode` – groups related views (e.g., `codebase-set-001`, `test-set-001`). Each set owns zero or more queries and views.
  - `QueryNode` – stores the Cypher (`cypherQuery`) to retrieve raw graph data. Menu wiring is via `(:SetNode)-[:HAS_QUERYNODE]->(:QueryNode)`. Duplicates exist (legacy import) so always rely on GUID and not the Neo4j internal id.
  - `ViewNode` – describes a canvas view (`layout_engine`, `renderer`, optional saved `layout`, `autoLayoutSettings`). They appear in the library via `(:SetNode)-[:HAS_VIEWNODE]->(:ViewNode)`; runtime views (e.g., `containment-orthogonal-runtime`) have no saved layout and now expect the runtime pipeline.

- **Current runtime gaps**:
  - Containment enforcement, collapse inheritance, and renderer styling are still legacy-driven. Children currently sit at their stored world coordinates, but we still need to clamp drag, resize parents around children, and surface inherited edges when ancestors collapse.
  - Renderer parity (badges/icons, selection halo, orthogonal waypoint caching) must be ported from the legacy containment renderer to `runtime-containment-renderer.ts`.
  - Interaction services (history, undo/redo, preset snapshots) are still wired around saved-layout flows. We need to confirm they operate solely on runtime snapshots.

- **Plan (next slices)**:
  1. **Geometry & containment** – feed parent/child world coordinates directly into the runtime solver, project them into relative positions, and reuse existing clamping utilities so children stay inside their parents after drags/collapses.
  2. **Collapse inheritance** – hook the runtime graph into the inherited-edge pipeline so collapsed nodes emit translucent edges (matching the orthogonal renderer’s behaviour).
  3. **Renderer parity** – port badges, selection outlines, and edge label placement into `runtime-containment-renderer.ts`; cache orthogonal waypoints just like the legacy renderer.
  4. **History & presets** – ensure runtime snapshots drive undo/redo and preset switching without referencing saved layouts.

- **How to validate**:
  - Reload the new view, run `window.__LAYOUT_DEBUG__ = true`, and confirm console output:
    ```
    [RuntimeContainment] Loaded raw runtime data {entityCount: 7, relationshipCount: 6}
    [LayoutRuntime] Processing raw data … activeEngine: 'containment-runtime'
    [ContainmentRuntimeEngine] Snapshot {nodes: Array(7), edges: Array(6)}
    ```
  - Graph should draw only the containment nodes; link nodes should no longer appear.
  - When geometry/clamping is implemented, dragging a child must keep it within its parent; collapsing should emit inherited edges.

---

## Current Execution Context (2024-12-??)

- **North Star**: Deliver a graph-powered, AI-centric observability platform. Visual authoring, view presets, and data-driven canvases are the active focus.
- **Preset & Styling State**:
  - Presets now include palettes, icons, badges, layout hints, and metadata tokens (`frontend/src/app/shared/graph/view-presets.ts`).
  - `preset-presentation` and the preset style applier translate raw metadata into renderer-friendly attributes, but preset-driven engine/renderer switching plus layout-hint propagation are still TODO.
  - Renderers draw richer visuals; the canvas engine must be updated so `setActivePreset` swaps layout/renderer/lens and forwards hints into layout runs.
- **Rendering Pipeline Gap**: `GraphStore.computePresentation` exists for diff-aware frames but the engine still clones entire hierarchies every render. Integrating presentation frames is a priority.
- **Runtime & Ingestion**:
  - `CanvasLayoutRuntime.setRawData` converts Neo4j entities into layout graphs, yet `Neo4jDataService` mixes parameterised requests with hard-coded fallbacks. We need metadata-rich ingestion, no placeholder data, and strict GUID usage.
  - Lenses (`GraphLensRegistry`) only filter cloned snapshots; a data-tier lens API/AI endpoint remains on the roadmap.
- **Database Inventory Highlights**:
  - Sets: `codebase-set-001`, `test-set-001` (legacy `Imported`), plus `code-model-set` (new schema).
  - Views (6 total): legacy imported canvases with saved layouts; `compliance-001` is orphaned; `code-model-view` is the clean model-driven entry with summary/detail.
  - Queries (6 total entries) include duplicates (same GUID/name, missing `id`) for “TestModularQuery” and “query-001”; duplicates show up in `HAS_QUERYNODE` edges. All future work must rely solely on GUIDs—never Neo4j internal ids.
  - Menu wiring is data-driven: `SetNode-[:HAS_VIEWNODE]->ViewNode` and `SetNode-[:HAS_QUERYNODE]->QueryNode`. Deduplicate the legacy relationships to avoid UI noise.
- **Immediate Implementation Steps**:
  1. Update preset switching to change layout engine, renderer, and lens, and pass `layoutHints` into layout runs.
  2. Route rendering through `GraphStore.computePresentation` for delta-aware frames.
  3. Harden Neo4j ingestion: eliminate placeholder data, parameterise Cypher, honour lenses/presets for filtered datasets.
  4. Clean the legacy Neo4j entries (dedupe `QueryNode`s/relationships, reattach or retire `compliance-001`) using GUID-based operations only.
- **Working Agreements**: Compile/test frequently, commit in small increments, and never touch Neo4j internal ids.




  
--------------

• Current State

  - Layout runtime – Contract + orchestrator are modern, async worker path exists, and engines (tree/containment/force/
    orthogonal) are registered through CanvasLayoutRuntime; legacy tab canvas & bespoke services have been culled, so the
    runtime is the only pathway. Missing pieces: scheduler only queues per canvas (no backpressure across canvases yet)
    and DynamicLayoutService still mutates snapshots instead of dispatching runtime commands.
  - Renderer pipeline – Canvas engine consumes presentation frames with deltas (frontend/src/app/shared/render/
    presentation-frame.ts), but renderers still walk entire hierarchies and cache invalidation is manual. WebGL/WASM
    service is separate—no shared geometry caches or GPU integration with the presentation frame yet.
  - Runtime state + events – Canvas event hub tracks layout events, but UI now hides the noisy history. Undo/redo is
    stack-based, not timeline-aware, and telemetry is only used for diagnostics—not persisted or surfaced.
  - Subgraph + lenses – Only three hard-coded lenses in the engine (composable-hierarchical-canvas-engine.ts); no data-
    store level filtering or AI-accessible lens API.
  - Interaction/automation – Canvas engine emits events and applies AI commands, but node edits delete relationships only
    via manual mutation; CRUD endpoints in the UI aren’t wired for graph persistence yet.
  - Performance foundations – Worker support exists, but prioritised updates are still coarse, there’s no view-based
    virtualisation, and renderer diffs rerender most of the scene. No shared caches or adaptive LOD.
  - UI shell – Panels exist, but docking/layout management, theming polish, and micro-frontend separation are still future
    work. Chat panel and properties now focus on core controls without event spam.

  What Matters Next (Priority → Why)

  1. Data ingestion & CRUD pipeline
      - Build a single source of truth that streams Neo4j/other sources into the runtime, exposes create/update/delete
        commands, and persists changes. Without this, layout work can’t demonstrate real editing or AI-assisted graph
        authoring.
  2. Visual authoring capabilities
      - Expand renderer primitives (icons, shapes, badges, edge styles) and offer template-based “view presets” so the
        same graph can appear as containment grids, timelines, swimlanes, etc. This delivers the “showcase” narrative and
        leverages the runtime we now have.
  3. Layout engine parity + hybrid interactions
      - Finish migrating reflow logic to the runtime (kill DynamicLayoutService mutations), add force-directed
        improvements (stabilisers, incremental updates), and support per-engine capability flags (constraints,
        clustering). Ensures layout-switching feels polished and unlocks force/containment editing scenarios.
  4. Interaction layer for AI + manual edits
      - Introduce declarative commands for add/remove nodes, edge rewiring, and property edits, with the orchestrator
  5. Renderer performance + GPU path
      - Add frame diff adherence (only draw changed nodes), shared geometry/text caches, and optional WebGL/WebGPU
        backend. This supports large datasets and the immersive feel you want without bogging down the UI.
  6. Subgraph & lens API
      - Allow AI/users to define lenses via filters/aggregations that the runtime materialises, then reuse across
        canvases/minimaps/analytics. This is the gateway to “focused views” and storytelling around the same dataset.
  7. Shell polish & extensibility
      - After the above, revisit docking, theming, and secondary panels (history, analytics) so the UI feels intentional
        rather than prototype-y.

  Priorities 1–4 directly unlock the immersive, AI-driven demo with editable graph data. Once CRUD, visual templates, and
  solid layouts are in place, performance and shell polish will keep the experience smooth at scale.

-----------

Claude assessment:
1. Current challenges: Dual engine stacks, renderer coupling, event surface limitations, performance issues, and
  composability problems
  2. Target improvements: Unified layout engine contract, stateful runtime, renderer pipeline overhaul, interaction
  parity, subgraph manipulation, performance foundations, and composable UI shell
  3. Implementation path: 7-step migration from legacy to new architecture
  4. Session notes from 2025-10-10: Debugging work to fix Code Model canvas rendering issues, including state
  isolation per view to prevent cross-canvas interference

  The main theme is transitioning from a legacy system to a declarative, event-driven architecture where layout
  engines are pluggable modules operating on immutable graphs.

> analysse the codebase and tell me how we are against that plan 

● I'll analyze the codebase to assess progress against the architectural plan outlined in sessions.md.

● Task(Analyze codebase architecture progress)
  ⎿  Done (42 tool uses · 97.8k tokens · 1m 59s)                                                                     

● Based on my analysis of the codebase against the architectural plan in sessions.md, here's the assessment:

  Overall Progress: ~60% Complete

  1. Unified Layout Engine Contract — 85% ✓

  Strong foundation established:
  - Formal LayoutEngine interface with LayoutCapabilities in frontend/src/app/shared/layouts/core/layout-contract.ts
  - 4 runtime engines: Tree, ContainmentGrid, Orthogonal, Force (all registered)
  - Immutable graph structures (LayoutGraph, LayoutResult)

  Gaps:
  - Legacy engines still run via ComponentFactory (dual execution paths)
  - Worker execution exists but disabled by default
  - Incremental layout declared but not implemented

  2. Stateful, Data-Driven Runtime — 70%

  Good progress:
  - LayoutRuntime with LayoutOrchestrator + GraphStore + PresentationFrame
  - Versioned snapshots and per-canvas contexts
  - CanvasViewStateService with canvas-specific channels

  Gaps:
  - Services bypass runtime (DynamicLayoutService, history)
  - No backend/worker coordination
  - Runtime not yet the single entry point — ComposableHierarchicalCanvasEngine (2244 lines) still has significant
  logic

  3. Renderer Pipeline Overhaul — 60%

  Partial implementation:
  - PresentationFrame calculates deltas between frames
  - Multiple composable renderers exist
  - Renderer registry maps layouts to renderers

  Critical gaps:
  - Renderers not read-only — canvas engine still mutates extensively
  - No WebGL/WebGPU — only Canvas2D (guide exists but not implemented)
  - Delta calculation exists but incremental rendering not used

  4. Interaction & Automation Parity — 75% ✓

  Well implemented:
  - 11 declarative event types in CanvasEventBus
  - AI integration via CanvasEventHub.processAssistantMessage()
  - History service with undo/redo (50-state limit)
  - Chat panel dispatches canvas events

  Gaps:
  - Legacy imperative methods coexist (toggleNodeCollapsed)
  - No unified timeline (history separate from event bus)
  - AI doesn't receive runtime metrics feedback

  5. Subgraph Manipulation — 50%

  Basic implementation:
  - 3 graph lenses: full-graph, selected-root-neighborhood, active-containment
  - CanvasLayoutRuntime.setLens() support

  Major gaps:
  - Lenses are client-side filters, not streaming queries
  - Hard-coded logic, no declarative API
  - No AI-requestable dynamic lenses
  - Filtering in canvas engine, not data layer

  6. Performance Foundations — 20% ⚠️

  Minimal progress:
  - Worker bridge exists but unused
  - Worker implementation file present

  Critical missing:
  - All layouts run synchronously in UI thread
  - No caching (geometry, text metrics, hit-testing)
  - No virtualization (renders all nodes)
  - No LOD (level-of-detail)
  - No GPU acceleration
  - No scheduling/priorities

  7. Composable UI Shell — 65%

  Decent foundation:
  - Modular panels (chat, properties, event history)
  - Panels subscribe to event bus observables
  - CanvasControlService for centralized control

  Gaps:
  - No docking/layout management
  - Not true micro-frontends (just Angular components)
  - No canvas embedding in other routes
  - Limited theming/transitions

  ---
  Key Blockers to "World-Class" Goal

  1. Performance is the biggest gap — everything synchronous, no optimizations, will stutter on large graphs
  2. Dual execution paths — legacy ComponentFactory vs. new runtime fighting each other
  3. Canvas engine still owns too much — not following read-only renderer pattern
  4. Subgraph queries not first-class — just client-side filters, can't power AI requests

  What's Working Well

  ✓ Layout contract is clean and formal✓ Event system enables AI/automation✓ State isolation per canvas (fixed in
  recent session)✓ Immutable data structures in place

  The architecture is solid but incomplete — good bones, needs the performance layer and full migration from legacy
  patterns.
  
---------

  Where we stand

  - Dual engine stacks: the orchestrator knows only tree/containment/orthogonal/force, but the modular canvas still
    spins up legacy engines (code-model-tree, grid, etc.) through ComponentFactory. We’re translating engine names
    on the fly rather than giving the orchestrator real, pluggable modules. That’s workable for a proof-of-life demo,
    but brittle for performance tuning, feature parity, or onboarding new layouts.
  - Renderer coupling: renderers are still ECS-style classes that mutate nodes in place and expect legacy data
    shapes. We aren’t feeding the runtime’s immutable graph results directly to lean, mode-aware renderers. That’s a
    big gap for FPS, incremental reflow, and GPU-friendly drawing.
  - Event surface, not yet orchestration: the chat panel feeds from the event hub, but most commands still fall
    through to old imperative methods (toggleNodeCollapsed, collapseToLevel). The AI can dispatch LayoutRequested,
    but doesn’t get a canonical “subgraph handle” or derived metrics to reason about. Undo/redo is local; there’s no
    shared timeline for AI vs. human actions.
  - Subgraph views: the data transform pipeline still pulls entire view nodes, clones them, and normalises via legacy
    adapters. We don’t have a streaming, query-based “extract subgraph/transform/present” flow that can be reused
    across map, tree, or timeline views.
  - Performance: layouts run synchronously in the UI thread; even the force engine just blasts through the entire
    node set. There’s no scheduling, no use of Web Workers, no caching of static layers, and no hierarchical LOD. On
    large graphs, we’ll stutter.
  - Composability: the runtime is a good start, but it isn’t yet the single entry point for the canvas. Services
    (history, dynamic layout, view state) still plug straight into the engine, bypassing the runtime. Without a
    clean dependency graph, we can’t easily spin up multiple canvases, embed them in other routes, or hand off layout
    requests to remote workers/AI agents.

  ———

  What we need for the “world-class” target

  1. Unified layout engine contract
      - Replace legacy adapters with thin wrappers (modules) that register into the runtime.
      - Engines declare capabilities (incremental, subgraph filters, constraints) and operate on immutable graph
        descriptors.
      - Move layout execution to dedicated workers or the backend for heavy workloads; keep UI thread free for
        rendering and interaction.
  2. Stateful, data-driven runtime
      - One authoritative graph store (versions, snapshots, derived indexes).
      - Orchestrator handles command queue, event routing, history, and multi-canvas coordination.
      - Subgraph queries (filters, clustering) are first-class so AI or the user can spin up a focused view without
        rehydrating whole datasets.
  3. Renderer pipeline overhaul
      - Renderers consume render-ready structures (geometry, styles, transitions) produced by layout + presentation
        transforms.
      - Support multiple rendering backends (Canvas2D, WebGL, WebGPU) via an adapter layer.
      - Incremental frame diffing: the renderer applies only the delta from the last layout, enabling smooth
        transitions and high FPS on large graphs.
  4. Interaction & automation parity
      - All user actions emit declarative events (e.g., RequestCollapse, MoveNode{target, desiredPosition,
        constraints}).
      - Orchestrator resolves them (applying rules, re-running layout) and emits results.
      - Undo/redo becomes timeline-aware (human and AI actions in the same log, branchable histories).
      - Chat/AI layer operates entirely via events/commands, with feedback from runtime metrics (e.g., “layout took
        32 ms, 12 nodes hidden”).
  5. Subgraph manipulation
      - Define per-view “graph lenses” that specify filters, aggregation, computed attributes (clustering,
        containment, dependencies).
      - Any lens can be attached to a canvas, minimap, or analytics widget.
      - Provide an API for AI to request new lenses (“show me components impacting latency > 200 ms”) and visualise
        results on the fly.
  6. Performance foundations
      - Asynchronous layout execution, prioritized updates (move 1 node vs. rerun entire layout).

  - Shared caches for geometry, text metrics, hit-testing.
  - Virtualisation for large graphs (only render nodes in view), adaptive level-of-detail.
  - GPU-accelerated rendering path to handle thousands of nodes smoothly.

  7. Composable UI shell
      - Extract activity bar, properties, chat, and history panels into modular micro-frontends that all subscribe to
        the event bus.
      - Provide docking/layout management so users can arrange panels and canvases.
      - Themeable, accessible design with smooth transitions.

  ———

  A path forward

  - Step 1: Refine the runtime contract (layout engine interface, event taxonomy, graph store). Migrate one legacy
    engine (e.g., grid) into the runtime fully to validate the pattern.
  - Step 2: Build the rendering facade that takes LayoutResult + optional presentation transforms and draws via a
    backend-agnostic renderer. Introduce incremental diffing.
  - Step 3: Move layout execution to workers and add a scheduling layer to orchestrator (command queue, priorities,
    async completion events).
  - Step 4: Formalize the command/event API for AI (collapse/expand, subgraph request, layout switch) and ensure both
    UI actions and chat commands go through the same path.
  - Step 5: Introduce graph lenses/subgraph queries as reusable units; refactor the data loader so every view uses
    them.
  - Step 6: Iteratively upgrade each existing view (code-model, containment) to use the new pipeline; delete the
    legacy adapters once parity is achieved.
  - Step 7: Polish the UI shell: panel docking, canvas minimaps, timeline view, immersive interactions (hover
    insights, command palette).

  ———

  Summary

  Right now we’ve proven the runtime can host multiple engines and feed the UI, but we’re still straddling old and
  new worlds. To reach the “world-class, immersive, AI-assisted graph UI” goal, we need to finish the consolidation
  (all layout/rendering through the runtime), formalize subgraph handling, and invest in performance (async layout,
  GPU rendering, diffed frames). That unlocks flexibility for the end user and makes the system truly composable and
  automation-friendly.

  If this direction sounds right, I can start by codifying the runtime contract and migrating one of the legacy
  engines end-to-end, or sketch the orchestration scheduler. Let me know which slice you’d like tackled next.
  
-------------------

What really gets you there

  1. Declarative, data-driven node model
      - Node fields (geometry, metadata, labels, edges) live in a single immutable graph/state store.
      - Layout engines take that graph and emit a transformed graph—nothing mutates it downstream.
  2. Pluggable layout engines with capability flags
      - Each engine (tree, orthogonal, Sugiyama, force, DAG‑reflow, etc.) implements an interface like

        interface LayoutEngine {
          getName(): string;
          apply(graph: LayoutGraph, options: LayoutOptions): LayoutResult;
          canHandleRealtime?: boolean;
        }
      - Engines declare if they support incremental reflow; the orchestrator only runs reflow for engines that opt
        in. Tree returns false, so none of the grid logic touches it.
  3. Event/Observer pipeline
      - All layout/app state updates are events (e.g. CollapseNode, ResizeNode, LayoutApplied).
      - Observers (renderers, AI agents, collaboration layer) subscribe and react without mutating the graph
        themselves.
  4. Renderer(s) read-only
      - Canvas/webgl/HTML renderers consume the LayoutResult and draw; selections/hit testing use the same metrics.
        They never massage coordinates on their own.
  5. Assistant/AI layer hooks into the same event bus
      - AI can propose “expand this branch”, “run clustering layout”, “raise edge weights”—by dispatching the same
        commands a human would. No hidden state.
  6. History & collaboration
      - Because everything is event-based, we can record/replay state for undo, real-time collaboration, or “AI
        explain what changed”.
  7. Runtime layout switching
      - Swap tree → force → orthogonal on the same graph without restarting. The orchestrator unloads the previous
        engine, loads the new one, and re-emits a LayoutResult.

  ### Why the current setup struggles

  - Layout, reflow, and render have been bleeding into each other. We hard-coded sizes, forced 400px in the engine,
    and used different collapsed widths in different modules—every move cascaded.
  - The dynamic reflow wasn’t layout-aware, so it kept battling the tree engine.
  - Metadata wasn’t authoritative; we’d compute the right numbers but never store them globally, so the selector/
    renderer/kernel got out of sync.

  ### What to do now

  We’ve already moved in the right direction today by:

  - Letting the tree engine own width/height and publishing the defaults in metadata.
  - Teaching the reflow service to stand down when displayMode === 'tree'.
  - Keeping the renderer/selector read-only.

  Take that refactor the rest of the way:

  1. Formal layout contract (as above).
  2. Refactor ComposableHierarchicalCanvasEngine so it just orchestrates: load engine → run → publish → render, no
     layout logic inside.
  3. Move all hard-coded shrink/expand to per-layout utilities: tree uses metadata defaults; containment can still
     shrink to 80×40 if it wants.
  4. Expose an event bus (CanvasEvent) so AI, collaboration, undo, etc. plug in cleanly.

  Once that skeleton is in place, you can add more engines, mix AI suggestions, or drive layout changes from data
  alone—and none of the components fight each other. It’s also the only way you’ll scale to those “huge amount more”
  plans without endless back‑and‑forth.

  So, no—the earlier “partial fixes” were not the holistic answer. The right approach is this layered, declarative
  architecture. We just started chipping away at it today; let’s keep going methodically so every new layout is a
  drop-in module instead of a tug-of-war.
  
------------------
you can grab the canvas component or its state service straight
  from the console and dump the whole CanvasData.

  Two easy options:

  1. Call the engine directly

     ng.getComponent(document.querySelector('app-modular-canvas')).engine.getData()
     That returns the exact structure the renderer is using (nodes, edges, camera, etc.).
     That returns the exact structure the renderer is using (nodes, edges, camera, etc.).
  2. Go through the shared state service

     ng.getInjector(document.querySelector('app-modular-canvas'))
       .get(ng.coreTokens.CanvasViewStateService)
       .getCurrentState('modular-canvas')

     (Replace the string if you’re on a different canvasId.) This is the authoritative snapshot that gets published
     to the collaborative layout pipeline.

  Either object is safe to console.log or JSON.stringify whenever you want a full dump.


› And can you call one of those directly from here?


• I can’t execute browser console calls from this CLI—the Angular component tree and window scope live in your
  running frontend, not in this shell. Grab the snippet:

  ng.getComponent(document.querySelector('app-modular-canvas')).engine.getData()

  …and paste it into your browser’s devtools console with the Code Model view open. That will dump the live
  CanvasData there.

  

# Session: Code Model Canvas Debugging (2025-10-10)

## User Goals
- Restore the Code Model canvas view, which rendered blank despite queries returning thousands of nodes.
- Ensure Angular build artifacts deploy reliably so the gateway serves current bundles.
- Diagnose and resolve cross-canvas interference that was pushing the Code Model viewport off-screen.

## What Was Done
1. **Rebuilt and Sanitised Assets**
   - Cleared old hashed bundles and pointed `angular.json` outputPath directly at `/workspace/runtime/frontend/dist`.
   - Rebuilt Angular multiple times, ensuring `index.html` references the latest `styles`, `runtime`, `polyfills`, and `main` hashes.
   - Removed stale bundles (e.g., `main.b231…`) so MIME errors disappeared.

2. **Instrumented Rendering Path**
   - Added temporary logs and overlays in `ComposableHierarchicalCanvasEngine` and `HierarchicalNodePrimitive` to confirm the renderer executed and to inspect screen-space bounds.
   - Verified the engine rendered the root node at `(x: 50, y: 50)` with size `≈ 993 × 400` but it later ended up off-screen (`screenY: -32992`), which hinted at external camera mutations.
   - Removed all debug visuals once diagnostics were complete.

3. **Isolated Canvas State per View**
   - Refactored `CanvasViewStateService` to store snapshots/mutations by `canvasId` and expose `getCanvasData$(canvasId)`.
   - Updated `ComposableHierarchicalCanvasEngine` to accept a `canvasId`, subscribe only to its own state stream, and publish back with the same `canvasId`.
   - Updated `DynamicLayoutService` so it reads the originating `canvasId`, clones that canvas' state, and publishes reflow results back to the same channel.
   - Set each `ModularCanvasComponent` instance's `canvasId` to the current ViewNode id, so different views never cross-pollinate camera/layout updates.

4. **Cleaned Repository**
   - Removed obsolete local scripts (`test_agent*.sh`, `test_files*.sh`, `test_tree_agent.rs`).
   - Committed changes as `de8c4f1 Isolate canvas state per view` and pushed to `origin/main`.

## What I Learned About the Codebase
- **Observer Model**: Canvas engines publish full state snapshots to `CanvasViewStateService`; other collaborators (like `DynamicLayoutService`) react to mutations and issue derived updates. Before today, this service acted as a global singleton without `canvasId`, allowing one engine’s camera to overwrite another’s.
- **Rendering Pipeline**: 
  - ViewNode → `ComponentFactory` selects layout + renderer.
  - `LayoutEngineAdapter` + `GridLayoutService` produce the hierarchy (many nodes nested under a single root).
  - `ComposableHierarchicalCanvasEngine` creates the renderer, wires shared state, applies collapse/default hierarchy, and renders via `ComposableContainmentOrthogonalRenderer` + `HierarchicalNodePrimitive`.
  - Previously, all canvases shared the same state bus; now each uses a dedicated channel keyed by `canvasId`.
- **Persisted View State**: The database stores ViewNode `layout` JSON and `autoLayoutSettings` (collapse/reflow). Those are separate from the runtime `CanvasViewStateService`; DB state is only restored on explicit save/load, while the service handles live inter-component communication.
- **Collapse Flow**: `collapseToLevel` still sets descendants via `showImmediateChildren`/`hideAllDescendants`. We verified root nodes remain expanded after the state isolation change.

## Outstanding / Recommended Next Steps
* Current status: Code Model canvas still renders blank and MIME errors persist; root node is drawn far off-screen (~25k x 35k).
1. **Camera Reset Logic**: Even with state isolation, the root node can still be off-screen if the stored camera in the DB is out of range or if the layout pushes heights beyond the initial viewport. Add a fallback centering routine (`centerOnInitialNode`) that runs after layout when no saved camera is present.
2. **Layout Diagnostics**: The root node reports thousands of children (8470) yet remains visually empty. Investigate whether `showImmediateChildren` + `hideAllDescendants` hides everything by design (collapsed badges) or whether we should render a placeholder when a container has collapsed children.
3. **Consistent Build Script**: Encapsulate the Angular build + hash cleanup into a single script (or CI job) to avoid manual rsync/index rewrites.
4. **Restore Single-Command Build Workflow**: Update `start.sh` (or similar automation) so it runs the Angular build, removes stale hashed bundles, copies the latest output into `/workspace/runtime/frontend/dist`, and then launches services. The goal is to get back to your “one command” workflow; ad-hoc rebuilds are still painful.
5. **Remove Ad-hoc Logging**: Any lingering `console.warn` or debug logs added during ongoing investigation should be cleaned up once the core display issue is resolved.
6. **Verify with Fresh Sessions**: After resetting the camera and layout logic, spin up a fresh environment to ensure the Code Model view renders at first load without needing manual zoom/pan.

The state-isolation refactor is now in place. The remaining work is to make sure the root node actually draws visible content (or at least its collapsed placeholder) once the camera is centred. Continuous testing with multiple canvases open simultaneously is recommended to validate the new per-canvas channels.
