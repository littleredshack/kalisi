Drop a pod into your world — and see the connections.

## 1. Model

Like an intelligent Miro board:
- Picture your world, or the problem you're trying to solve — and you'll see the links.

BYOM (Bring Your Own Model): business or personal.
- Take in any model data in any format: diagrams, documents, recordings, regulations...
- Business architectures, software stacks, a process, your thoughts, books...

## 2. Monitor

Connect live data streams to your model.
Turn a static picture into a living system.

## 3. Analyze

Uncover opportunities, patterns, risks, and dependencies hidden in complexity.
Ask "what if?" and test scenarios before making changes.

## 4. Adapt

Start small, repeat and scale. Your model grows with you.
Evolve and keep control.
