# Kalisi

A docker pod to model with graphs. Includes drawing frontend, neo4j admin and coding terminal

## 1. Model

Like an intelligent Miro board:
- Draw a model of your world, or the problem you're trying to solve â€” that gets you started.

BYOM (Bring Your Own Model): business or personal.
- Import model data from anywhere: diagrams, documents, recordings, regulations...
- Model anything: business architecture, software stack, a process, your thoughts, books...

## 2. Monitor (coming)

Connect live data streams to your model.
Turn a static picture into a living system.

## 3. Analyze (coming)

Uncover opportunities, patterns, risks, and dependencies hidden in complexity.
Ask "what if?" and test scenarios before making changes.

## 4. Adapt

Start small, repeat and scale. Your model grows with you.
