# Kalisi

A drop-in pod for managing complexity in a connected world.

## 1. Model

Like a Miro board: draw a picture of the problem and you are solving it already 
BYOM (Bring Your Own Model) - import models, diagrams, documents, etc
Model anything — a software stack, a compliance process, even something personal.
Every shape and link is stored in a graph, so everything stays connected.

## 2. Monitor

Connect live data streams to your model.
Turn a static picture into a living system.

## 3. Analyze

Uncover patterns, risks, and dependencies hidden in complexity.
Ask “what if?” and test scenarios before making changes.
Move from reactive to predictive.

## 4. Adapt

Start small, repeat and scale. Your model grows with you. 
Evolve and keep control.
