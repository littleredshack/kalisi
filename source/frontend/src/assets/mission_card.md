# Kalisi

A docker pod to model with graphs. Includes drawing frontend, neo4j admin and coding terminal

## 1. Model

Like an intelligent Miro board:
- Draw a picture of your world, or the problem you're trying to solve - that gets you started.

BYOM (Bring Your Own Model) - business or personal - connect it all in the graph.
- Create models from anything: diagrams, documents, recordings, regulations, SYSML, BPMN ...
- Customise views: business architectures, software stacks, processes, mindmaps ...

## 2. Monitor and Measure (coming)

Connect live data streams to your model.
Turn a static picture into a living system.

## 3. Analyze (coming)

Uncover opportunities, patterns, risks, and dependencies hidden in complexity.
Ask "what if?" and test scenarios before making changes.

## 4. Adapt

Start small, repeat and scale. Your model grows with you.
