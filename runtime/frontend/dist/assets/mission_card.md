# Kalisi

A graph-powered Docker pod that lets you visualise your connected world â€” with visual frontend, Neo4j admin, and AI terminal.

## 1. Model

Like an intelligent Miro board:
- Draw a picture of your world or the problem you're trying to solve.
- Bring Your Own Model - business or personal - every model becomes a graph.
- Create models from diagrams, documents, recordings, regulations, UML, SYSML, BPMN.
- Customise views: business architectures, software stacks, processes or mind maps.

## 2. Monitor and Measure (coming)

Connect live data streams to your model.
Turn a static picture into a living system.

## 3. Analyze (coming)

Uncover opportunities, patterns, risks, and dependencies hidden in complexity.
Ask "what if?" and test scenarios before making changes.

## 4. Adapt (coming)

Start small, repeat and scale. Your model grows with you.
